# Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

This folder contains Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configurations using Terraform. It includes reusable modules and environment-specific configurations to manage cloud resources efficiently.

## Directory Structure

- `modules/`: Contains reusable Terraform modules for various cloud resources.
- `environments/`: Contains environment-specific configurations (e.g., dev, staging, production).
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts for bootstrapping and managing Terraform state.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the IaC setup.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Terraform**: Make sure you have [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed.
2. **Configure your provider**: Update the provider configuration in the respective environment files.
3. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` in the desired environment directory.
4. **Plan your changes**: Use `terraform plan` to see what changes will be made.
5. **Apply your changes**: Run `terraform apply` to create or update resources.

Feel free to explore the modules and customize them as needed for your infrastructure requirements.
