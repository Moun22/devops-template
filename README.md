## Purpose
This repository serves as a template for setting up and managing DevOps pipelines and infrastructure. It provides a standardized structure and reusable components to streamline the development, deployment, and monitoring of applications.

## Components
The repository includes the following key components:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
    - Terraform scripts for provisioning cloud resources.
    - Ansible playbooks for configuration management.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
    - Pre-configured pipelines for popular CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI).
    - Templates for build, test, and deployment stages.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Integration with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
    - Predefined dashboards and alerting rules.

4. **Containerization**:
    - Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests for containerized applications.
    - Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments.

5. **Security**:
    - Static code analysis and vulnerability scanning tools.
    - Secrets management integration.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moun22/devops-template.git
   cd devops-template
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file and populate it with required variables (e.g., cloud provider credentials, application-specific settings).

3. **Provision Infrastructure**:
    - Navigate to the `infrastructure` directory and run Terraform:
      ```bash
      cd infrastructure
      terraform init
      terraform apply
      ```

4. **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines**:
    - Update the pipeline configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows`, `Jenkinsfile`) with your project-specific details.

5. **Deploy Applications**:
    - Use the provided Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts to deploy your application:
      ```bash
      kubectl apply -f k8s/
      ```

6. **Configure Monitoring**:
    - Import the provided Grafana dashboards and set up alerting rules.

## Usage Examples
### Running a CI/CD Pipeline
1. Push your code changes to the repository.
2. The pipeline will automatically trigger, running build, test, and deployment stages.

### Deploying a New Service
1. Add your service's configuration to the `services/` directory.
2. Update the Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.
3. Deploy the service:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f services/your-service.yaml
   ```

### Monitoring Application Health
1. Access the Grafana dashboard at `http://<grafana-url>`.
2. View metrics and logs for your application.
